# Decisions

Due to time and other constrains, the main features I decided to focus on were:

- Docker
- Models and Database
- Endpoints

I did not have time to learn about Celery and implement it, although I'd liked to and probably will
in the future.

In the same way, I didn't develop the frontend part of the application to focus on the API,
since that's where I have the most experience.

Dealing with Docker wasn't too hard, as I've done multiple projects with it at this point.
I had to catch up on a lot of Django, since I haven't used it in a while.
Still, it was a nice refresh of concepts.

I'd loved to get into some of the extended features, specifically the security related features like
the implementation of JWT, something I've already tinkered with in the past.

There is so much more I'd liked to do, but in the end I had to focus on getting a base working
rather than running without securing the foundations of the project.
