# Task Management System

This project is a technical test for a Fullstack Python developer internship.
As such, it has specific requirements that have to be met in order to be considered complete.

## Quick Start

To launch the application, run the following commands in your terminal.
The dependencies are exclusively Docker, as the application itself is handled inside a container.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ColmiiK/task-management.git
cd task-management
cp .env.sample .env
docker-compose up
```
